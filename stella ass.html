<h2> MY ACHIEVEMENT </h2>

<br><b>My name is Ajayi Stella, a student of kwara state university(kwasu), I'm based in ibadan,</b>
<b>oyo state, am born into the family of five. I attended Funmilayo Comprehensive College, Owode,</b> 
<b>Apata, Ibadan. My first achievement was when i participated in a 200m race in Obafemi Awolowo </b>
b>Liberty Stadium, where i won a golden medal & i was appreciated by the coach and other officials.</b>
<b>The race was a memorable one for me. It was the first international race that i ever participated in.</b>
<b>Also, being chosen as the Head girl and sport prefect in my school was another achievement for me,</b>
<b>because i did not expect to be given a post not even to be awarded two(2) position (head girl and sport prefect).</b>
<b>THINK BIG empowerment conference was another achievement i can think of, where i participated in various activities</b>
<b>like Quiz, debate, handiwork and other various activites, which at the end i was awarded a certificate.</b>
<b>Also another achievement was gaining admission into kwara state university & also been able to study the</b> 
<b>course of my choice.<b>
<b>I'm also hoping to achieve more in future with the guidance of God.</br>
